  <h3>2021 New Year Card</h3>
  <!-- <img src="New-Year-Card.jpg" class='center' id="img"> -->
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hZT1doL.jpg" class='center' id="img">
  <p>This New Year's Card is something I created based on a spur of the moment decision to celebrate the oncoming New Year in some way while also utilizing a new device I received as a gift for Christmas. Thus, on the day before New Year's Eve of
    2020, I chose to forsake sleep in favor of completing the card in time for sharing at midnight to welcome in the New Year. The card itself features elements of the old as well as the new through the incoporation of the cow (2021 being the
    year of the ox) as well as the toilet paper which essententially summed up the entirety of 2020. Elements from traditional Japanese New Year's cards are also included, such as cherry blossoms and the postage stamp on the top left.

  <h3>Teddy Circus</h3>
  <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  <script src="balloon.js"></script>
  <div id="myContainer"></div>
  <p>"Teddy Circus" originates from my desire to create a culmination of my favorite aesthetics as a representation of my so-called avatar. The said aesthetics include a classical circus theme as well as teddy bears with mismatched colorings. The
    mismatched coloring of the bear is also a slight nod to my occasional tendency to experiment with numerous hair colors, including split hair colors. The avatar includes an interactive "balloon-popping" game, a counter keeping track of the
    number
    of balloons popped, a confetti button, and a microphone input controlling the bear's arms. Pressing the bowtie of the bear also causes the button eyes to move.
    <br><br>
    In terms of the narrative behind the piece, my main inspiration came while I was playing the Nintendo Switch game, "Animal Crossing." Prior to playing the game, I struggled immensely on choosing what I wanted as my avatar. With no thought in
    mind while coding, I even created a demented geometric flower which, thankfully, did not come into fruition. Ultimately, in order to take my mind off of the art block I was in, I decided to play some "Animal Crossing." It is through the
    elements in that game (namely one of my favorite villagers, Stitch, and the color scheme of a rocking horse furniture) that inspiration finally hit me. I was reminded of aesthetics that I have always loved, and it is there that things began
    to snowball. This project being my first ever experience with Javascript, I was highly motivated to learn about new techniques and incorporating them in the final product. This piece became my baby in the way that it was constantly on my mind
    and I was working on it even while asleep. Specifically, there was an instance where I could not, for the life of me, figure out why the code was not working and I went to sleep frustrated. Yet, as soon as I woke up (even before opening my
    eyes), the answer simply hit me, and I hurriedly ran downstairs to my laptop in order to implement it as soon as possible.
